##  Natal origin estimation of foraging green turtles

This github repository was made to post the scripts used in the study Hamabata et al. (in review).



- **Raw read data** were deposit in GenBank BioProject accession BioProject PRJDB13199 (released after acceptance).
- **Reference genome** was downloaded from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_015237465.2#/st) (rCheMyd1.pri.v2) published in [Bentley et al. (2023)]().
