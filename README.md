#  Natal origin estimationof foraging green turtle using genome-wide SNPs:

This github repository was made to post the codes that were used in the study Hamabata et al. (in review).

### Raw read data
All the read files (fastq format) were deposit in GenBank BioProject accession 

### Reference genome 
Reference squence (fasta format) of green turtle, <i>Chelonia mydas</i> was downloaded from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_015237465.2#/st) (rCheMyd1.pri.v2).

Although, in this Github repository, we add the link to jump the sofware information, we used the Biocontainers Singularity Images that are available in [NIG Supercomputer system](https://sc.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/en/) for some software without installing in our own environment.
