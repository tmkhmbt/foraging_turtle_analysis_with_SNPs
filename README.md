##  Natal origin estimation of foraging green turtles

This github repository was made to post the scripts used in the study Hamabata et al. (in review).



- **Raw short-read data** were in GenBank BioProject accession PRJDB13199 (released after acceptance).
- **Reference genome** was downloaded from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_015237465.2#/st) (rCheMyd1.pri.v2) published in [Bentley et al. (2023) PNAS](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2201076120).

Analyses using the discriminant analysis principal component (DAPC) (Jombart et al. 2010) in adgenet package for R were according to the [tutorial by Jombart & Collins (2015)](https://adegenet.r-forge.r-project.org/files/tutorial-dapc.pdf).
