##  Natal origin estimation of foraging green turtles

This github repository was made to post the scripts used in the study Hamabata et al. (in review).



- **Raw short-read data** were in GenBank BioProject accession PRJDB13199 (released after acceptance).
- **Reference genome** was downloaded from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_015237465.2#/st) (rCheMyd1.pri.v2) published in [Bentley et al. (in press)]().

Although, in this Github repository, we add the link to jump the sofware information, we used the Biocontainers Singularity Images that are available in NIG Supercomputer system for some software without installing in our own environment.
